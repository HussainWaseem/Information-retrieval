Inverted index in python

## For both type of collections there are two programs. 
1. ***index_funtions.py*** is written by the use of functions
2. ***index.py*** is written without the use of functions
3. There is also one text file of **Stopwords** for both type of collections. 

## For english inverted
 I used the Porter2Stemmer for stemming.
